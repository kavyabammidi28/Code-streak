#âœ… Day 8: FizzBuzz Problem
#Problem:
#Write a program that prints numbers from 1 to 50.
#For multiples of 3, print "Fizz" instead of the number.
#For multiples of 5, print "Buzz" instead of the number.
#For numbers which are multiples of both 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz".

    for i in range(1, 51):
        if i % 3 == 0 and i % 5 == 0:
            print("FizzBuzz")
        elif i % 3 == 0:
            print("Fizz")
        elif i % 5 == 0:
            print("Buzz")
        else:
            print(i)
