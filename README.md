# ðŸ”¥ Code Streak â€“ Daily Coding Practice

Welcome to my **Code Streak** repository! This is where I challenge myself to code **every day** â€” solving problems, learning new concepts, and growing as a developer.

## ðŸ’¡ Purpose
The goal of this streak is to:
- Build consistency and discipline
- Improve problem-solving skills
- Strengthen my understanding of algorithms and data structures
- Track my daily coding progress in one place
